# The program and planned feedback activities 

This alpha program provides you with the unique opportunity to test the seamless experience that we aim to build by leveraging the best of both worlds. Workfront for work planning and monitoring as well as managing the review & approval process of requested assets and Frame.io for creative collaboration and conducting the review & approval.    

As part of the alpha program, we're going to work closely together to shape what will become the future unified formal review & approval experience across Adobe.  

Therefore, we will establish certain communication channels that will allow us to stay connected, share updates and get your hands-on feedback. Our goal is to understand what capabilities would be required that will allow your company and users to adopt this solution in your Production environment. Please use the following communication channels to share your feedback: 

# Communication Channels 

## Alpha demo & MVP prototype feedback calls (per customer) 

The Adobe Team is going to set up multiple individual meetings with each alpha customer to present the MVP prototype along with the experience released to your preview / sandbox environment. During these calls you will get the opportunity to provide feedback and let us know your thoughts around the way we envision the future unified review & approval and what is needed to have you adopt this in Production. Please reach out to your group's spokesperson to learn when the next call is scheduled for. The plan is to start with weekly calls until we have captured all your feedback and then move onto a less frequent call cadence. 

Besides the guided demo / feedback sessions we encourage you to continue exploring the experience and perform further tests with the various groups and persona's involved. Please follow these basic instructions on how to test the solution. 

## Slack Channel (per customer) 

The Adobe Team is going to set up and invite your alpha testing group to a Slack Workspace. This space is intended to accelerate communication and allow you to easily share and discuss ideas outside the scheduled calls but also submit issues you come across. Please talk to your testing group's spokesperson in case you haven't been invited to this slack workspace. 

Please read the best practices section on how to best submit ideas and issues 

## Email 

Use this communication method to submit feedback, especially ideas that contain confidential information or material (screenshots or screen recordings) that you don't want to share with other Adobe customers but Adobe only. 

# Send feedback 

We value your input and believe that your perspective is crucial in helping us create the best experience possible. Because we're specifically looking at understanding what capabilities would be required to have you adopt the solution in Production, please   

Mention it during our regular demo/feedback calls 

Share it on our alpha program slack channel  

Or send it via e-mail to ossmann@adobe.com 

## How to best submit ideas 

Please try to give as much context as possible by describing 

The goal you want to achieve (aka "Job-to-be-done") 

the problem that keeps you from achieving this goal 

how a potential solution could look like 

Don't forget to include screenshots or screen recordings as well as examples to best describe your idea.  

## How to best submit issues / bugs 

In case you discover any issues or bugs please share them via our Slack channel so it's easier for the team to ask questions and have them resolved as soon as possible. 

Please try to give as much context as possible by answering the following questions: 

What did you expect to happen? 

What really happened? 

Steps to reproduce the issue?  

Please attach a screenshot if possible -->
